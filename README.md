### Weather app that fetches data and displays weaather for a week

This app displays the weather data for a week

### API in use

I am using https://open-meteo.com/ in this app but you can change that tto your liking.
This api does not require api key so, can be used right off the box

### Starting the app

1. Download the repo
2. Open the project in Vscode
3. npm install
4. npm start

This will spin off the dev server and any necessary adjustments can be made
